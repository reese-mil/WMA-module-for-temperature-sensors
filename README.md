# WMA-module-for-temperature-sensors

### Project Overview
This repository contains the Verilog code for a Weighted Moving Average (WMA) module and a dynamic threshold selector. It is developed for detecting anomalies in thermal sensors in MPSoCs.

### Repository Structure

#### WMA_Calculator
<strong>wma_calculator.v<strong/> - Verilog file implementing the Weighted Moving Average (WMA) calculator.<br>
tb_wma_calculator.v - Verilog testbench file with test cases and outputs for WMA calculator.<br>
main.v - Verilog file to run testbench file.

#### Dynamic_Threshold_WMA
dynamic_threshold_wma.v - Verilog file implementing the dynamic threshold selection logic.<br>
tb_dyn_threshold_wma.v - Verilog testbench file with test cases and outputs for dynamic threshold selector.<br>
main.v - Verilog file to run testbench file.
